   CSCI 5015 Assignment 4
   <br>
   Due March 16, 11:59 PM.

   </h1>
    
   <h2>Objective</h2>
   <p>
      Use pandas and work with multiple files
   </p>
   
   <h2>Data set</h2>
   <p>
      You've been given a data set from the National Highway Traffic
      Safety Administration (NHTSA).
      The data comes from their
      <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/research-data/fatality-analysis-reporting-system-fars" target="_blank">
          Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)</a>.
      This particular data set represents the traffic fatalities in the
      United States during 2016.  In each file, one line or record represents
      data for one accident.
   </p>
   <p>
      For this assignment, the data is contained in a
      folder named <code>FARS</code>.  Each state's
      data is contained in a data
      file named <code>accident_XX.csv</code>, where <code>XX</code> is a two-digit
      code for a state.  The first column in the data files have
      the same state code/number.
      Use this table to match states to their code:
   </p>
   <table id="state_data">
      <tr><td>1</td><td>Alabama</td><td>31</td><td>Nebraska</td></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>Alaska</td><td>32</td><td>Nevada</td></tr>
      <tr><td>4</td><td>Arizona</td><td>33</td><td>New Hampshire</td></tr>
      <tr><td>5</td><td>Arkansas</td><td>34</td><td>New Jersey</td></tr>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>California</td><td>35</td><td>New Mexico</td></tr>
      <tr><td>8</td><td>Colorado</td><td>36</td><td>New York</td></tr>
      <tr><td>9</td><td>Connecticut</td><td>37</td><td>North Carolina</td></tr>
      <tr><td>10</td><td>Delaware</td><td>38</td><td>North Dakota</td></tr>
      <tr><td>11</td><td>District of Columbia</td><td>39</td><td>Ohio</td></tr>
      <tr><td>12</td><td>Florida</td><td>40</td><td>Oklahoma</td></tr>
      <tr><td>13</td><td>Georgia</td><td>41</td><td>Oregon</td></tr>
      <tr><td>15</td><td>Hawaii</td><td>42</td><td>Pennsylvania</td></tr>
      <tr><td>16</td><td>Idaho</td><td>43</td><td>Puerto Rico</td></tr>
      <tr><td>17</td><td>Illinois</td><td>44</td><td>Rhode Island</td></tr>
      <tr><td>18</td><td>Indiana</td><td>45</td><td>South Carolina</td></tr>
      <tr><td>19</td><td>Iowa</td><td>46</td><td>South Dakota</td></tr>
      <tr><td>20</td><td>Kansas</td><td>47</td><td>Tennessee</td></tr>
      <tr><td>21</td><td>Kentucky</td><td>48</td><td>Texas</td></tr>
      <tr><td>22</td><td>Louisiana</td><td>49</td><td>Utah</td></tr>
      <tr><td>23</td><td>Maine</td><td>50</td><td>Vermont</td></tr>
      <tr><td>24</td><td>Maryland</td><td>52</td><td>Virgin Islands (since 2004)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>25</td><td>Massachusetts</td><td>51</td><td>Virginia</td></tr>
      <tr><td>26</td><td>Michigan</td><td>53</td><td>Washington</td></tr>
      <tr><td>27</td><td>Minnesota</td><td>54</td><td>West Virginia</td></tr>
      <tr><td>28</td><td>Mississippi</td><td>55</td><td>Wisconsin</td></tr>
      <tr><td>29</td><td>Missouri</td><td>56</td><td>Wyoming</td></tr>
      <tr><td>30</td><td>Montana</td></tr>
   </table>
   <p>
      The FARS folder also contains the file <code>nst-est2017-alldata.csv</code>,
      which has population estimates of the United States.  This data comes
      from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/state-total.html" target="_blank">
         U.S. Census Bureau</a>.  The column, <code>POPESTIMATE2016</code>,
         contains the population esitmate for each state in 2016, which is the
         same year as the crash data.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Coding instructions</h2>
   <p>
      Create a Jupyter notebook file named <b>assignment4.ipynb</b>.  Unzip the file,
      <strong>FARS.zip</strong> and place the folder
      <strong>FARS</strong>
      in the same folder as your notebook.  
   </p>
   <p>
      Make the first cell in your notebook a Markdown cell and create
      a header that says "FARS Analysis" and then on the next line,
      have a plain paragraph that says "Written by John Nicholson" 
      (hopefully, it is obvious that
      you should replace my name with your name).  It should look roughly like this
      after you render the Markdown:
   </p>
   <div class="markdown_example">
      <h1>FARS Analysis</h1>
      <p>Written by John Nicholson</p>
   </div>
   <p>
      Use your notebook to answer the questions below.
      Your notebook should have both code cells and Markdown cells.
      The code cells should read and process the data,
      and the Markdown cell should explain what the associated code cell does
      and why you wrote the code
      the way you did.  If you wish, add extra cells to
      make your main code easier to read and use.
   </p>
   <h3>Requirements</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>
         No single code cell should produce all the output for more than
         one question.
         At a minimum, you will need 9 code cells, one for each question.
      </li>
      <li>
         If you make additional code cells, they do not have to display data.
         For example, you may want to write a helper
         function in a code cell.  You
         still need a Markdown cell describing the function and why you wrote the
         function in the first place.
      </li>
      <li>
         All code cells need a Markdown cell explaining what the code does
         and why you wrote it the way you did.  Explanations should be
         complete sentences and paragraphs,
         use good grammar, and be spell-checked.
      </li>
      <li>
         Before turning in your notebook, ensure that all code cells
         that produce output have their output displayed.  I should not
         have to run your notebook in order to see the output.  You should
         all render all Markdown cells.  That is, I should
         not see the special
         Markdown characters like the <code>#</code>.  I should see nicely rendered text.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Questions</h3>
   <p>
      For all questions, don't output codes.  Output the state names, day names, etc.
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         For each state, what day of the week has the most accidents?
         Use the <code>DAY_WEEK</code> column.  Output the day and the count. For the values
         output the day name, where 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday, ... and 7 is Saturday.
      </li>
      <li>
         For whole United States, i.e., all the data,
         what day of the week has the most accidents?
         Output the day and the count.
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            For each state, what hour of the day has the most accidents?
            Output the hour and the count.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>A value of 99 in the HOUR means unknown.</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
         For whole United States, what hour of the day has the most accidents?
         Output the hour and the count.
      </li>
      <li>
         For each state, what is the percentage of fatal
         accidents involved at least one drunk driver?
         If the column, <code>DRUNK_DR</code>, has a 0, then no drunk drivers
         were involved.  Any number larger than 0 indicates the number of
         drunk drivers involved in the accident.
      </li>
      <li>
         For whole United States, what is the percentage of fatal
         accidents involved at least one drunk driver?
      </li>
      <li>
         <p>
            For whole United States, how many fatalities were caused by
            each type of collision?  Use the <code>MAN_COLL</code> column.  The values in the
            column are below.
         </p>
         <table>
            <tr><td>0</td><td>Not Collision with Motor Vehicle in Transport</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>Front-to-Rear</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>Front-to-Front</td></tr>
            <tr><td>6</td><td>Angle</td></tr>
            <tr><td>7</td><td>Sideswipe – Same Direction</td></tr>
            <tr><td>8</td><td>Sideswipe – Opposite Direction</td></tr>
            <tr><td>9</td><td>Rear-to-Side</td></tr>
            <tr><td>10</td><td>Rear-to-Rear</td></tr>
            <tr><td>11</td><td>Other (End-Swipes and Others)</td></tr>
            <tr><td>98</td><td>Not Reported</td></tr>
            <tr><td>99</td><td>Unknown</td></tr>
         </table>
      </li>
      
      <li>
         For each state, what is its fatal accident rate per 10,000 people?
         To calculate this, count the number of accidents in a state,
         divide by the state's 2016 population estimate from the
         <code>nst-est2017-alldata.csv</code> Census data file,
         and then multiply by 10000.
         Output the states' rates in order from highest to lowest.
      </li>
      
      <li>
         For each state, what is the rate of fatal accidents caused by drunk driving
         per 10,000 people?
         To calculate this, count the number of accidents in which a drunk
         driver was involved,
         divide by the state's 2016 population estimate from the
         <code>nst-est2017-alldata.csv</code> Census data file,
         and then multiply by 10000.
         Output the states' rates in order from highest to lowest.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Tips and help</h2>
   <p>
      Remember, we talked about files and listing directories in the previous lecture.
   </p>
   <p>
      When you are running code, you may not
      see results right away.  You should look to the left of the code cell for the
      <code>In [ ]:</code> marker.  If you see a number, for example, <code>In [8]:</code>,
      the code in the cell is not currently
      running.  But if you see an asterisk, for example, <code>In [*]:</code>,
      the code in the cell is running on the kernel,
      and results may not be available yet.  The asterisk should change
      to a number when the code is done.
   </p>
   <p>
      Remember, you can stop a running cell by choosing the "stop" button in the menu.
      It is the one that looks like a black square.
   </p>
   <p>
      You can always come see me in my office or send me email.  If you send me email,
      you should send your code as an attachment.  Don't copy/paste your code into
      the message because that will make it harder for me to debug your code.  Send your file
      as a <code>.ipynb</code> file
   </p>
   
   <h2>Submission</h2>
