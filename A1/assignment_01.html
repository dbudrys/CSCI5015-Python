   CSCI 5015 Assignment 1
   <br>

   </h1>
    
   <h2>Objective</h2>
   <p>
      Use Python to compute basic statistics for data in a file.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Background</h2>
   <p>
      You've been given a data file, data.txt, which contains
      data from experiments for a new environmental sensor.
      The sensor is still being developed
      and is being tweaked to find the settings for
      optimal performance.  The project's
      engineers are running experiments to find settings
      that allow the sensor to work reliably and are recording their
      data in the file you've been given.
   </p>
   <p>
      The data file has five columns of data.  Each column represents
      the data collected during an experiment with the sensor. Column 1
      represents experiment 1, column 2 represents experiment 2,
      and so on.  All the values in the file are positive numbers greater
      than or equal to 0.  Each number is a float and all values
      have 5 digits of precision after the decimal point.
   </p>
   <p>
      The 
      engineers want you to calculate the following statistics
      for each column / experiment:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>The maximum value, $max$, found in each column</li>
      <li>The minimum value, $min$, found in each column</li>
      <li>
         The range of values, $range$, found in each column, where<br>
         <span style="margin-left:3em;">
            $range = max - min$
         </span>
      </li>
      <li>
         The sum, $sum$, of all the values in each column,
         where<br>
         <span style="margin-left:3em;">
            $sum = \sum_{i=1}^{N}x_i$
         </span>
      </li>
      <li>
         The average value, $\bar{x}$, of each column,   
         where<br>
         <span style="margin-left:3em;">
            $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_i}{N}$
         </span>
      </li>
      <li>
         The standard deviation, $s$, of each column, where<br>
         <span style="margin-left:3em;">
            $s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{N-1}}$
         </span>
      </li>
      <li>
         The variance, $s^2$, of each column, where the variance is square
         of the
         standard deviation, $s$.
      </li>
   </ul>
   
   <h2>Coding instructions</h2>
   <p>
      Create a Python file named <b>assignment1.py</b> and place the data file
      <b>data.txt</b> in the same folder.  Add a comment at the top of your
      file with your name, for example
   </p>
   <pre><code>    # Written by John Nicholson </code></pre>
   <p>
      Your program should open the data file
      for reading and compute the seven required values for
      each column/experiment.  Since there are 5 columns,
      you will be computing 35 values in total.
   </p>
   <p>
      Output the results to a second file named <b>results.txt</b>.
      Ensure that each value is labeled so that the person reading the file
      knows which statistic - $max$, $min$, $range$, $sum$, $\bar{x}$ (average),
      $s$ (standard deviation), and $s^2$ (variance) - and which experiment -
      1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 -
      is associated with each value.  Add a statement at the top of the file
      with your name.
      Output the data in a
      format similar to the following (obviously replacing XXXX for real numbers):
   </p>
   <code><pre>
      Prepared by John Nicholson
      
      Experiment 1
         max:      XXXX
         min:      XXXX
         range:    XXXX
         sum:      XXXX
         average:  XXXX
         stddev:   XXXX
         variance: XXXX
         
      Experiment 2
         max:      XXXX
         min:      XXXX
         range:    XXXX
         ...
   </pre></code>
   
   <p>
      The purpose of this assignment is to ensure you can code basic Python, so you
      should not
      not use any external library.  Therefore, there is
      one restriction on your program: you may not have any <code>import</code>
      statements in your code,
      except
      for the one required to use <code>sqrt()</code>, the square root function.  Here is some sample code demonstrating
      the function:
   </p>
   <pre><code>
      <b>from math import sqrt</b>

      x = 4
      y = <b>sqrt(x)</b>

      print("The square root of {} is {}".format(x, y))
   </code></pre>
   <p>
      Otherwise, you can complete this assignment using the topics we discussed
      in the first two lectures.  You can use other features of Python
      if you wish, as long as they don't require an import statement.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Tips and help</h2>
   <p>
      The data file is big.  You might want to create a similar, yet smaller file,
      to test you program on.  This way you can place values in the small file
      that you know the answers for.  Write your program and test it on that file.
      Once you are sure your program works on the small file, change it to work on the
      big file.
   </p>
   <p>
      You can always come see me in my office or send me email.  If you send me email,
      you should send your code as an attachment.  Don't copy/paste your code into
      the message because that will make it harder for me to debug your code.  
   </p>
   
   <h2>Submission</h2>
   <p>
      When your program is correct, log into D2L and locate the Dropbox for assignment 1.
      Upload the two files
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>assignment1.py</li>
      <li>results.txt</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      into the D2L dropbox.
